## 📓 Full-featured Notebook Implementation

Main notebook: `notebooks/azure_langchain_exploration.ipynb`

```python
from langchain.llms import azure_openai, openai, huggingface_hub, google_palm, ai21, cohere, forefront_ai, goose_ai, writer
from langchain.embeddings import azure_openai_embeddings, openai_embeddings
from langchain.vectorstores import faiss, milvus, qdrant
from langchain.chains import llm_chain_qa_with_sources_for_retrieval_augmentation as qa_wsr_aug
from langchain.prompts import prompt_template_from_file_path as ptffp 
import os 

os.environ["AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your_api_key"
os.environ["AZURE_SEARCH_API_KEY"] = "your_search_api_key"
```
