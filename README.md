Full-Featured Notebook Implementation
The main notebook LangChain_Azure-centric.ipynb demonstrates:
# Azure OpenAI integration with enterprise features
azure_llm = AzureChatOpenAI(
    azure_deployment=azure_config.azure_openai_deployment,
    azure_endpoint=azure_config.azure_openai_endpoint,
    api_key=azure_config.azure_openai_api_key
)
# Azure AI Search replacing third-party search
@tool
def azure_search(query: str) -> str:
    """Search using Azure AI Search for enterprise knowledge"""
    # Implementation with Azure Search SDK
Modern LangChain Patterns (2025)
	• LangGraph agents replacing legacy AgentExecutor patterns
	• Azure Application Insights monitoring with OpenTelemetry integration
	• Comprehensive cost tracking for Azure OpenAI usage
	• Enterprise-grade error handling with fallback patterns
	• Conversation persistence with Azure Cosmos DB threading
