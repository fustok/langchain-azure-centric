# Azure LangChain Integration

## üöÄ What's New

### üîó Complete Azure Services Integration
- **Azure OpenAI** as the primary language model provider with enterprise security
- **Azure AI Search** replacing Tavi.ly for web search and knowledge retrieval
- **Azure Application Insights** replacing LangSmith for monitoring and telemetry
- **Azure Cosmos DB** for scalable agent memory and conversation persistence
- **Azure Key Vault** for secure credential management
- **Azure Machine Learning** integration ready for model evaluation

---

## üß± Comprehensive Project Structure
- Azure-focused configuration with in-depth examples for all service settings
- Production-ready dependencies in `requirements.txt` with Azure-specific packages
- VS Code workspace configuration with Azure development extensions
- Detailed Jupyter notebooks for step-by-step Azure service setup
- Enterprise-ready design with Azure-specific patterns

## üìì Full-featured Notebook Implementation

Main notebook: `notebooks/azure_langchain_exploration.ipynb`

```python
from langchain.llms import azure_openai, openai, huggingface_hub, google_palm, ai21, cohere, forefront_ai, goose_ai, writer
from langchain.embeddings import azure_openai_embeddings, openai_embeddings
from langchain.vectorstores import faiss, milvus, qdrant
from langchain.chains import llm_chain_qa_with_sources_for_retrieval_augmentation as qa_wsr_aug
from langchain.prompts import prompt_template_from_file_path as ptffp 
import os 

os.environ["AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your_api_key"
os.environ["AZURE_SEARCH_API_KEY"] = "your_search_api_key"
```
